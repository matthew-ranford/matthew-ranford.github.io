    <h1>JavaScript and its relationship to HTML & CSS</h1>
    <p>
      Think of the following as the human body; HTML is the bone structure which
      is all the writing on the page by itself, which also includes images etc.
      no style to it just the foundation of the webpage. <br />
      CSS is the flesh of the webpage where you start to see the beauty and
      colour of it, along with the positioning of all your content<br />
      JavaScript is the muscle of the webpage where interactivity and
      functionality happens, for instance, you click on a button and then
      something else happens. <br />
      HTML & CSS are scripting languages, whereas JavaScript is a programming
      language. <br />
      The Document Object Model or 'DOM' for short provides the means to
      manipulate the HTML document with JavaScript and ties your HTML & CSS
      together.

    <h1>Control Flow & Loops</h1>
    <p>
      So, lets say that everyday during the work week up until thursday, you
      have the exact same routine with absolutley no changes whatsoever. You
      wake up on friday and you are sick and you stay in bed all day. Now
      because you are sick your routine has changed for that day, it no longer
      meets the conditions of your routine for those first four days. That loop
      you were on is no longer true and the conditions of your routine have now
      changed to false because of this day in bed. Ending the Loop. <br />
      Control flow in JavaScript refers to the order in which the computer
      executes statements in the script, starting from the first line and ending
      at the last line. <br />
      Loops are apart of the control flow in JavaScript, basically, there is a
      start and end point and conditions in-between. If you never had that sick
      day in bed the loop would have continued to run because the conditions
      still evaluated to true, but as soon as the routine ended with the sick
      day, the conditions evaluated to false, ending the loop.
