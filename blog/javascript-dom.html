        <h1>JavaScript and its relationship to HTML & CSS</h1>
        <p class="header-p">
          Think of the following as the human body; HTML is the bone structure
          which is all the writing on the page by itself, which also includes
          images etc. no style to it just the foundation of the webpage.
        </p>
        <p class="header-p">
          CSS is the flesh of the webpage where you start to see the beauty and
          colour of it, along with the positioning of all your content
        </p>
        <p class="header-p">
          JavaScript is the muscle of the webpage where interactivity and
          functionality happens, for instance, you click on a button and then
          something else happens.
        </p>
        <p class="header-p">
          HTML & CSS are scripting languages, whereas JavaScript is a
          programming language.
        </p>

        <h1>Control Flow & Loops</h1>
        <p class="header-p">
          So, lets say that everyday during the work week up until thursday, you
          have the exact same routine with absolutley no changes whatsoever. You
          wake up on friday and you are sick and you stay in bed all day. Now
          because you are sick your routine has changed for that day, it no
          longer meets the conditions of your routine for those first four days.
          That loop you were on is no longer true and the conditions of your
          routine have now changed to false because of this day in bed. Ending
          the Loop.
        </p>
        <p class="header-p">
          Control flow in JavaScript refers to the order in which the computer
          executes statements in the script, starting from the first line and
          ending at the last line.
        </p>
        <p class="header-p">
          Loops are apart of the control flow in JavaScript, basically, there is
          a start and end point and conditions in-between. If you never had that
          sick day in bed the loop would have continued to run because the
          conditions still evaluated to true, but as soon as the routine ended
          with the sick day, the conditions evaluated to false, ending the loop.
        </p>

        <h1>The DOM & how you interact with it</h1>
        <p class="header-p">
          The Document Object Model or 'DOM' for short provides the means to
          manipulate the HTML document with JavaScript and ties your HTML & CSS
          together.
        </p>
        <p class="header-p">
          Picture a tree, and each branch is a node (which is made up of your
          HTML document content); with JavaScript you may manipulate the content
          on any of these nodes; for instance try clicking this button below!
        </p>
        <p class="header-p">
          This is an example of how you may interact with HTML content with DOM
          manipulation. The button element has an ID of "button" which can be
          access with JavaScript and now when the button is clicked the inner
          HTML will change! Showing at a basic level how JavaScript powers the
          interactivity within the website.
        </p>
        <button id="button">CLICK ME!!</button>

        <h1>Difference between accessing data from Arrays & Objects</h1>
        <p class="header-p">
          An Array is like a shopping list, where you can add many items to
          them, varying from one word, to a few, numbers, decimal numbers and so
          on.. see example below:
        </p>
        <img class="wide" src="../images/array-example.png" alt="" />
        <p class="header-p">
          While there is 7 items in this list, the item named 'list' is actually
          only at position 6 of this array, this is because an array starts at a
          0 index.
        </p>
        <p class="header-p">
          So if i wanted to grab the first element in the array(shopping list),
          i could; console.log(array[1]) and this would log 'i am Matt' to the
          console. Array's aren't very handy on their own, but are perfect when
          it comes to loops!
        </p>
        <p class="header-p">
          An Object is a little different to the shopping list style of an Array
          where it's sort of like the contacts directory in your phone. Check
          example below:
        </p>
        <img src="../images/object-example.png" alt="" />
        <p class="header-p">
          With an Object, you have a key, value pair. Key = Name, Value =
          Matthew. If you wanted to update someone's details from your main
          directory (phoneContacts), you could do the following:
        </p>
        <img class="wide" src="../images/object-example1.png" alt="" />
        <p class="header-p">
          This is called dot notation, as you see the periods between each
          Object name. Like a phone, you would go into phone contacts, then
          click on contact name, and finally update name.
        </p>

        <h1>Functions & why they are helpful</h1>
        <p class="header-p">
          Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript,
          they're very versatile and allow you to re-use code wherever
          necessary. It's like going to the dentist and each step in the process
          of getting your teeth checked the dentist has a process in place for
          each checkup.
        </p>
        <p class="header-p">
          Each check is conducted in the same way but will occasionally run into
          a problem, that's where you have the flexibility to reuse this code to
          add in variables that you encounter. The function is like a dentists
          assitant who processes the function in a way that's effortless and
          with each checkup, the function is invoked and all the information is
          there for the dentist to work with.
