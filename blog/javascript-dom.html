    <h1>JavaScript and its relationship to HTML & CSS</h1>
    <p>
      Think of the following as the human body; HTML is the bone structure which
      is all the writing on the page by itself, which also includes images etc.
      no style to it just the foundation of the webpage. <br />
      CSS is the flesh of the webpage where you start to see the beauty and
      colour of it, along with the positioning of all your content<br />
      JavaScript is the muscle of the webpage where interactivity and
      functionality happens, for instance, you click on a button and then
      something else happens. <br />
      HTML & CSS are scripting languages, whereas JavaScript is a programming
      language.
    </p>

    <h1>Control Flow & Loops</h1>
    <p>
      So, lets say that everyday during the work week up until thursday, you
      have the exact same routine with absolutley no changes whatsoever. You
      wake up on friday and you are sick and you stay in bed all day. Now
      because you are sick your routine has changed for that day, it no longer
      meets the conditions of your routine for those first four days. That loop
      you were on is no longer true and the conditions of your routine have now
      changed to false because of this day in bed. Ending the Loop. <br />
      Control flow in JavaScript refers to the order in which the computer
      executes statements in the script, starting from the first line and ending
      at the last line. <br />
      Loops are apart of the control flow in JavaScript, basically, there is a
      start and end point and conditions in-between. If you never had that sick
      day in bed the loop would have continued to run because the conditions
      still evaluated to true, but as soon as the routine ended with the sick
      day, the conditions evaluated to false, ending the loop.
    </p>

    <h1>The DOM & how you interact with it</h1>
    <p>
      The Document Object Model or 'DOM' for short provides the means to
      manipulate the HTML document with JavaScript and ties your HTML & CSS
      together. <br />
      Picture a tree, and each branch is a node (which is made up of your HTML
      document content); with JavaScript you may manipulate the content on any
      of these nodes; for instance try clicking this button below!
      <br />
      This is an example of how you may interact with HTML content with DOM
      manipulation. The button element has an ID of "button" which can be access
      with JavaScript and now when the button is clicked the inner HTML will
      change! Showing at a basic level how JavaScript powers the interactivity
      within the website.
    </p>
    <button id="button">CLICK ME!!</button>
    <img src="../images/js-button-example.png" alt="" />

    <h1>Difference between accessing data from Arrays & Objects</h1>
    <p>
      An Array is like a shopping list, where you can add many items to them,
      varying from one word, to a few, numbers, decimal numbers and so on.. see
      example below: <br />
      <img src="../images/array-example.png" alt="" /> <br />
      While there is 7 items in this list, the item named 'list' is actually
      only at position 6 of this array, this is because an array starts at a 0
      index. <br />
      So if i wanted to grab the first element in the array(shopping list), i
      could; console.log(array[1]) and this would log 'i am Matt' to the
      console. Array's aren't very handy on their own, but are perfect when it
      comes to loops! <br /><br />
      An Object is a little different to the shopping list style of an Array
      where it's sort of like the contacts directory in your phone. Check
      example below: <br />
      <img src="../images/object-example.png" alt="" />
      <br />
      With an Object, you have a key, value pair. Key = Name, Value = Matthew.
      If you wanted to update someone's details from your main directory
      (phoneContacts), you could do the following: <br />
      <img src="../images/object-example1.png" alt="" />
      <br />
      This is called dot notation, as you see the periods between each Object
      name. Like a phone, you would go into phone contacts, then click on
      contact name, and finally update name.
    </p>

    <h1>Functions & why they are helpful</h1>
    <p>
      Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript,
      they're very versatile and allow you to re-use code wherever necessary.
      It's like going to the dentist and each step in the process of getting
      your teeth checked the dentist has a process in place for each checkup.
      Each check is conducted in the same way but will occasionally run into a
      problem, that's where you have the flexibility to reuse this code to add
      in variables that you encounter. The function is like a dentists assitant
      who processes the function in a way that's effortless and with each
      checkup, the function is invoked and all the information is there for the
      dentist to work with.

    <script>
      document.getElementById('button').addEventListener('click', (event) => {
        document.getElementById('button').innerHTML =
          'Wow i changed, so snazzy right!'
      })

      let array = ['Hello', 'i am Matt', 30, '30', 2.75, 'array', 'list']
      console.log(array[1])

      let phoneContacts = {
        firstContact: {
          Name: 'Matthew',
          Number: 123,
        },
        secondContact: {
          Name: 'Dane',
          Number: 456,
        },
        thirdContact: {
          Name: 'Corey',
          Number: 789,
        },
      }
      console.log(phoneContacts)

      let updateContact = phoneContacts.firstContact.Name

      updateContact = 'Matt'

      console.log(updateContact)
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
