    <h1>JavaScript and its relationship to HTML & CSS</h1>
    <p>
      Think of the following as the human body; HTML is the bone structure which
      is all the writing on the page by itself, which also includes images etc.
      no style to it just the foundation of the webpage. <br />
      CSS is the flesh of the webpage where you start to see the beauty and
      colour of it, along with the positioning of all your content<br />
      JavaScript is the muscle of the webpage where interactivity and
      functionality happens, for instance, you click on a button and then
      something else happens. <br />
      HTML & CSS are scripting languages, whereas JavaScript is a programming
      language. <br />
      The Document Object Model or 'DOM' for short provides the means to
      manipulate the HTML document with JavaScript.
