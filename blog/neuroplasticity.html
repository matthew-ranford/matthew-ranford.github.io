          Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity and how it benefits
          people:
        </h1>
        <p class="header-p">
          The more you practice or repeat an activity the neurons in your brain
          fire, when you continuously repeat or perform tasks it strengthens
          connections between the cells. It is understood that the brain is
          plastic, moldable and constantly changing and can not only affect the
          way your brain works but also its physical shape and structure. Mental
          practice is as important if not more important than the physical
          practice in an area. While you need to put the work in physically, you
          need to adjust your thought patterns in a positive manner otherwise
          your hard work and repetitions physically can be undone by your
          thinking patterns.

          For instance; this year i have been practcing gratitude, morning and
          evening. By training my brain to see the the things i'm grateful for,
          even if they have been challenging, it's allowing me to grow in a
          positive way and also learn from the things that i would have
          previously thought of as 'bad'. My brain is now searching for the good
          or the meaning on a daily basis, it requires practice every day. It's
          not always easy but by showing up and doing the practices even if i
          don't want to, makes every day a little easier and i'm not instantly
          looking at circumstances as a negative but an opportunity to expand
          and grow as a person.

          If you fail, you have the opportunity to learn from it and grow. How
          you view and react to the problem is crucial so it doesn't keep

          In this exploration, it had already changed for me at the beginning of
          this year properly. I always had a fixed mindset and was under the
          assumption i could never get better, evolve or do anything great. This
          growth mindset has been in the works for a couple of years now because
          i knew there had to be a better way and life wasn't what i made it out
          to be. It was always like my mind was stuck in a 'mental prison' and
          one day the cell door was left ajar and i finally made my escape.
        </p>
        <p class="header-p">
          This year i have put in so much work to find the 'real me' and one of
          the big reasons was because, someone i barely knew one night asked
          "why do i do that? after i had told him what i had been doing this
          year in terms of trying to teach myself to code, and the various
          things i was trying to do to better myself, but still thought it
          wasn't good enough. The next day i asked myself "Why do i do that?",
          which led me on a reflection about previous experiences as to why i
          treated myself the way i had.
        </p>

        <p class="header-p">
          In a couple of months my life changed; to positive self-talk,
          gratitude, not needing validation from others apart from my own and
          showing up for myself every day for the small wins. I still have a lot
          of room to grow and it takes a lot of hard-work everyday, but i have
          seen the positive growth in a couple of months and that can really
          turn your life around! So i will be continuing with this
          growth-mindset, and trying to quieten the voices, especially so far
          regarding JavaScript. If i keep showing up everyday and wiring my
          brain to learn it, staying positive in the hard-moments and looking
          for a way forward, it will work out!

          Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence

        <p class="header-p">
          My learning plan won't alter to much i don't beileve, at this stage
          anyway. I know i have learned a lot this year and want to continue to
          do so, the hardest part is keeping the voices at bay and showing up
          for myself everyday. I know i will struggle, which i have done a bit
          with some of the JavaScript content, but i need to continue to
          implement what i have been doing all year and not getting discouraged
          when i have challenging moments.
        </p>
        <p class="header-p">
          If i can continue to show up for myself and then other people
          everyday, i will continue to learn and grow! I had a whole life being
          stagnant and no moving forward so i need to continue to work at what
          i'm doing, especially on the darkest of days!
