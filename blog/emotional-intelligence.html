        <h1>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h1>
        <p class="header-p">
          Is the ability to manage both one's own emotions and understand the
          emotions of others (recognise, interpret, and process emotions in
          yourself and others)
          <br />
          <br />
          Five key elements: self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation,
          empathy, social-skills.
          <br />
          <br />
          It's about learning how to recognise, process and channel your
          emotions in a way that benefits you and your team.
          <br />
          <br />
          Enhancing your emotional intelligence requires effort but it can be
          achieved with sustained practice.

        <h1>How is EQ different to IQ?</h1>
        <p class="header-p">
          Emotional Intelligence (EQ) refers to a person's ability to understand
          his/her emotion along with other people's emotions, whereas
          Intelligence Quotient (IQ) indicates a person's intelligence level.
          <br />
          <br />
          IQ ability: Learn, understand and implement knowledge, logical
          reasoning and abstract thinking.
          <br />
          <br />
          EQ ability: Recognize, control and express one's own emotion's,
          perceive and assess other's emotion's.
          <br />
          <br />
          It has been researched that people with high EQ have better mental
          health, job performance, the way of living life.
          <br />
          <br />
          Your IQ is what determines your competencies and individual
          capacities, but your EQ determines how you interact and treat people
          in your life, it shows how you are going to cope with pressures or
          face the crisis. The difference between these two is that no one can
          alter his/her intelligence or reasoning abilities, but anyone can
          learn to handle emotions, to bring success for him/her.
        </p>

        <h1>Why is EQ important?</h1>

        <p class="header-p">
          A high EQ can help build relationships, reduce team stress, defuse
          conflict, improve job satisfaction, and increase team productivity and
          staff retention.
          <br />
          <br />
          Emotional Intelligence is especially important when dealing with
          stressful situations like conflict, change, and obstacles. Being
          emotionally intelligent is a key component of compassion and
          understanding the deeper reasons behind other people's actions.
          <br />
          <br />
          Emotional Intelligence can help each of us build and maintain stronger
          and better relationships.
