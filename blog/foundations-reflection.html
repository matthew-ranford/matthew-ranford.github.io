          What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
          due to the core learning?
        </h1>
        <li class="header-list">
          Comparing yourself to others is still a big factor, when you see other
          people asking questions with their complicated looking code they have
          written that you still don't fully understand or they may be a few
          challenges ahead of you, it's very easy to still compare yourself to
          others. I know as bootcamp went on i did fight with those thoughts and
          i know i got better at it as time went on because at the end of the
          day it doesn't really matter as long as you keep showing up for
          yourself. I don't think it's the fact that other people can write the
          code or solve the problems, it's more i'm comparing myself to myself
          and i'm disappointed that i can't do a certain thing and think i
          should be doing better already. But if it was easy, then everyone
          would be doing it and i know if i keep showing up it'll click.

        <li class="header-list">
          Not asking as many questions as i should for i guess the 'fear' of
          putting a question in the chat that may be simple to everyone else or
          i'm the only one that's not getting it. I will be looking to improve
          on this when bootcamp starts or i won't get anywhere and that will
          make me look more ridiculous. Struggling by yourself is no way to live
          and grow. Although, i find it easier to help myself and other people
          rather than have people help me..

        <li class="header-list">
          I have gained much more confidence this year compared to previous
          years and have realised that this has come from putting myself in
          uncomfortable situations and trying new things. That being said, for
          all of the things that i was getting correct through foundations in
          terms of JavaScript, my confidence still took a hit when i couldn't
          get it right or had to try and find a solution to implement to make my
          code work which in turn would make me procrastinate in situations
          because i wasn't getting it so i didn't at times want to start again.
          At the same time, i did keep reminding myself to look at what i've
          achieved this year and throughout this foundations course and in
          previous challenges. Although i still have a long way to go, in my
          Tech & Core learnings, i still show up every day and attempt these
          challenges. My positivity in that sense doesn't waver and if i can
          find a way to write JavaScript, these learnings and failings will make
          me better for it. I also could of remained fearful and not attended
          this course because of what is happening with JavaScript, i could've
          remained stagnant and attempted something comfortable. But like life,
          this is a journey and i need to find a way to grow in confidence even
          more and move forward with one step at a time, because one step is
          bigger than standing still.

          What are the roles of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning
          and programming?
        </h1>
        <p class="header-p">
          I beileve it's like anything else in life, and they all play a vital
          role in how you learn & interact with yourself and other people.
          Remembering to remind yourself that learning how to code can be
          difficult and like anything you will have challenging days. Showing
          empathy not only towards others but yourself because it's so easy to
          be critical of yourself if you aren't getting it like you think you
          should be. I became more aware of how i was feeling in certain
          instances as time went on throughout foundations which reminded me
          that i may not be the only one feeling this way, i feel as though we
          are so quick to feel as though we are the only ones going through
          those challenges and everyone else isn't. Because of this i would
          always try and offer any assistance or help in anyway as people may be
          suffering in silence. It's also right there in the question,
          'learning', that's exactly what it is, just because you aren't getting
          something right doesn't mean you have failed, it means you are
          learning and to keep evolving in the process.
