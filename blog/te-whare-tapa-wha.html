          I've found exercise and doing the hard tasks early in the morning very
          beneficial this year, putting in the hard yards on the body has made
          me feel mentally stronger especially on the days when i don't feel
          like doing it. Caring for my body in a better manner, like stretching
          and eating properly throughout the day has allowed me to focus more
          clearly! I've pretty much cut out dairy, gluten, refined sugars and
          have found my wellbeing this year to be in a much better place! Its
          tough work but rewarding!

          I've incorporated a lot into a discipline this year which has been so
          affective and i've really enjoyed, it's not always easy but it's made
          the world of difference and has become so much easier to control as
          the months have gone on. I never enjoyed who i was when i was
          drinking, especially because i would try and drink too much and keep
          up with everyone and be hungover throwing up every weekend and never
          changed it. Getting out of that loop and not trying to please people
          just because "everyone else is drinking" has been huge. The other
          massive change has been the power of meditation, positive self-talk
          and gratitude which i was never good at, it's turned my mental
          wellbeing completely around and recommend all of these changes highly.
