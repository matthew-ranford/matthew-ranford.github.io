        <h1>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h1>
        <p class="header-p">
          My initial comments haven't changed much, i still feel the same in
          that sense. I do like to help people out so getting into something
          that has to do with mental health or an area like that would be great,
          i think that is a huge thing that needs more care. If you read some of
          my other blogs you'll see how that kind of thing made me feel for the
          majority of my life and how much of an impact it can make so maybe
          that sort of avenue.
        </p>
        <p class="header-p">
          I would also love to be able to travel, i'm not much of a
          materialistic sort of person and would rather be happy than consumed
          by money (although i'm not ignorant to suggest that you don't need
          some money to be able to do the things that make you happy) but living
          a little more comfortably and experiencing new things would be great.
        </p>

        <p class="header-p">
          I'm sort of a go with the flow & not have a definite position in mind
          kind of person. Keep my options open and try various avenues, i want a
          balance to keep myself grounded and not be run down with just work.
          Before i can think any further of what i would like to become, i need
          to out my foot down and pass the bootcamp, because i won't be going
          anywhere if i can't get through that.
        </p>

        <h1>
          What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in
          Bootcamp?
        </h1>
        <p class="header-p">
          Reflecting on what i had previously wrote, i think it will be along
          the same lines for both my strengths & limitations. I have the desire
          to learn and get better but at the same time i could feel myself
          comparing to others at various points and had to quickly track back on
          that and remind myself that it only matters what i am doing. I got
          stuck and i still feel stuck on JavaScript, so i have been nervous for
          the bootcamp because of this. If i continue to not get it and not
          progress then i don't know if the 'old me' will resurface, i don't
          know.. only time will tell i suppose. I won't give up though and i
          know that this time has got to be different. I felt a tendency to
          procrastinate at times when it came to some of the JavaScript content
          because i wasn't understanding it and i know i can't continue down
          that path.
        </p>

        <h1>
          What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp
          will be?
        </h1>
        <p class="header-p">
          Avoiding burnout and keeping a balance to maintain healthy standards.
          If i can't keep my health right, my standards will slip. Asking
          questions & letting people know if i don't understand, i won't be a
          help to anyone if i suffer in silence. Also communicating idea's in a
          clear and concise way to people, this is something that will be a
          challenge. I have never studied before (apart from high school and i
          wouldn't really consider that as learning as i didn't really care) so
          the whole concept is foreign and unknown territory. This is another
          chapter to add to the book of putting myself out there & trying
          fearful things. I just hope my positivity remains and the work i have
          been putting in to find myself isn't a facade.
        </p>

        <h1>
          What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see
          developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
        </h1>
        <p class="header-p">
          I think it's pretty similar to my first answer, communication is
          something i have been working on want to continue to work on.
          Especially when it comes to explaining things in a clear way and not
          repeating myself. I want to become an even better listener, back
          myself and continue to believe in myself and generally improve in all
          area's.
        </p>

        <h1>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h1>
        <p class="header-p">
          Again, along the lines of the first answer i had. If i'm struggling, i
          hope to get some help and prompts in directions so i can better
          understand where i'm going wrong and why i'm not getting it. I
          wouldn't want to be just given answers because you don't learn
          anything from that and keep the accountability in check.
        </p>

        <h1 class="title">Foundations Learning Plan</h1>
        <h1>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h1>
        <p class="header-p">
          In the first instance i would love to help friends/family by building
          websites for their first time business adventures or being able to
          update their current sites if they have one. I've always loved Tech
          and beileve it's going to only get bigger as the years go by, it seems
          like an exciting space to be in with amazing opportunities everywhere!
        </p>
        <p class="header-p">
          I don't really have a focused career pathway as such, i like to keep
          my options open and be able to give various areas a go and not get so
          consumed by one avenue that i may not be passionate about. Becoming a
          Junior Developer and gaining the skills, critical-thinking, mindset,
          and being around like-minded individuals is what i'm looking at - but
          before i get there, i need to pass Foundations and then the Bootcamp;
          these four months are all i'm focused on at this stage!
        </p>

        <h1>
          A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
          learning:
        </h1>
        <p class="header-p">
          My strengths include; honesty, trustworty, accountability,
          communication, organised, positivity, and helping others. While i'm
          already strong in most of these areas naturally, i'm still working on
          them whenever i can as well. I'm persistant and have the ability to go
          after things i want to do without any encouragement or validation from
          anyone, i try new things and i had the curiosity to self-teach myself
          how to code and look where i am now. My limitations include; sometimes
          getting stuck on concepts for a bit longer than necessary because i
          think i'm not 'getting it', not being happy with something i've done
          and continuously tweaking it towards something that seems 'more
          perfect', need to develop a better use for the timebox method, and
          frustration can come out if a concept isn't making sense to me.

          What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
          developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
        </h1>
        <li class="header-list">
          Communication skills especially when it comes to explaining things in
          plain english, that's definitely been a problem area for me
        </li>
        <li class="header-list">
          I've found doing things you fear or make you nervous to be hugely
          impactful this year, getting involved with conversations more and
          being the first to speak is something i want to continue to improve on
        </li>

        <h1>
          A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme:
        </h1>
        <p class="header-p">
          Conduct myself the way i always do; look for the positives or the
          meaning in something, especially if it's not going in the right
          direction. Be compassionate, listen and speak to people when they are
          down or need help. Keep up with my daily discipline to keep myself, my
          mind, and body in the right way. Otherwise, you're no help to anyone,
          not even yourself.
        </p>
        <p class="header-p">
          My focus is directly on this course for four months, it's one of the
          best decisions i've made and i'm very grateful for, and i won't be
          wasting my time or anyone else's. It's only four months in the grand
          scheme of things and showing up for myself and my cohort peers on each
          of these days is what i'll give, especially on the darkest of days.
          Because after the darkest of days there is always light. I'll do what
          needs to be done when the time comes!
        </p>

        <h1>
          A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way:
        </h1>
        <p class="header-p">
          If i need help, and i can't help myself in the first instance, i will
          reach out to my facilitator or the team through discord. Communication
          is essential in all areas so i will not be afraid to do so if
          necessary! Seeking help isn't a weaknesses and assuming someone knows
          more than me in any area can only benefit me by reaching out!
        </p>

        <h1>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team:</h1>
        <p class="header-p">
          Keeping me accountable for what i'm working towards, if i'm going off
          track or taking to long in areas to get me back into line. If there's
          something i'm not understanding, not force feed the information but
          prompt me. Regular weekly catchups and helping with any questions is
          appreciated!
        </p>

        <h1>
          Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
          committed to other things. It's important to plan these in:
        </h1>
        <p class="header-p">
          I'm all in, i have a routine that i generally keep on a daily basis
          and it works well. If it changes, i'll adapt and work at different
          times. If anything comes up, i'll find a work around and either do the
          work before the committment or after. It's four months and i can
          handle it!
