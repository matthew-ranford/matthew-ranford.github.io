        <h1>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h1>
        <p class="header-p">
          In the first instance i would love to help friends/family by building
          websites for their first time business adventures or being able to
          update their current sites if they have one. I've always loved Tech
          and beileve it's going to only get bigger as the years go by, it seems
          like an exciting space to be in with amazing opportunities everywhere!
        </p>
        <p class="header-p">
          I don't really have a focused career pathway as such, i like to keep
          my options open and be able to give various areas a go and not get so
          consumed by one avenue that i may not be passionate about. Becoming a
          Junior Developer and gaining the skills, critical-thinking, mindset,
          and being around like-minded individuals is what i'm looking at - but
          before i get there, i need to pass Foundations and then the Bootcamp;
          these four months are all i'm focused on at this stage!
        </p>

        <h1>
          A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
          learning:
        </h1>
        <p class="header-p">
          My strengths include; honesty, trustworty, accountability,
          communication, organised, positivity, and helping others. While i'm
          already strong in most of these areas naturally, i'm still working on
          them whenever i can as well. I'm persistant and have the ability to go
          after things i want to do without any encouragement or validation from
          anyone, i try new things and i had the curiosity to self-teach myself
          how to code and look where i am now. My limitations include; sometimes
          getting stuck on concepts for a bit longer than necessary because i
          think i'm not 'getting it', not being happy with something i've done
          and continuously tweaking it towards something that seems 'more
          perfect', need to develop a better use for the timebox method, and
          frustration can come out if a concept isn't making sense to me.

          What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
          developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
        </h1>
        <li class="header-list">
          Communication skills especially when it comes to explaining things in
          plain english, that's definitely been a problem area for me
        </li>
        <li class="header-list">
          I've found doing things you fear or make you nervous to be hugely
          impactful this year, getting involved with conversations more and
          being the first to speak is something i want to continue to improve on
        </li>

          Give and receive feedback in constructive ways. - Continue to build on

        <h1>
          A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme:
        </h1>
        <p class="header-p">
          Conduct myself the way i always do; look for the positives or the
          meaning in something, especially if it's not going in the right
          direction. Be compassionate, listen and speak to people when they are
          down or need help. Keep up with my daily discipline to keep myself, my
          mind, and body in the right way. Otherwise, you're no help to anyone,
          not even yourself.
        </p>
        <p class="header-p">
          My focus is directly on this course for four months, it's one of the
          best decisions i've made and i'm very grateful for, and i won't be
          wasting my time or anyone else's. It's only four months in the grand
          scheme of things and showing up for myself and my cohort peers on each
          of these days is what i'll give, especially on the darkest of days.
          Because after the darkest of days there is always light. I'll do what
          needs to be done when the time comes!
        </p>

        <h1>
          A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way:
        </h1>
        <p class="header-p">
          If i need help, and i can't help myself in the first instance, i will
          reach out to my facilitator or the team through discord. Communication
          is essential in all areas so i will not be afraid to do so if
          necessary! Seeking help isn't a weaknesses and assuming someone knows
          more than me in any area can only benefit me by reaching out!
        </p>

        <h1>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team:</h1>
        <p class="header-p">
          Keeping me accountable for what i'm working towards, if i'm going off
          track or taking to long in areas to get me back into line. If there's
          something i'm not understanding, not force feed the information but
          prompt me. Regular weekly catchups and helping with any questions is
          appreciated!
        </p>

        <h1>
          Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
          committed to other things. It's important to plan these in:
        </h1>
        <p class="header-p">
          I'm all in, i have a routine that i generally keep on a daily basis
          and it works well. If it changes, i'll adapt and work at different
          times. If anything comes up, i'll find a work around and either do the
          work before the committment or after. It's four months and i can
          handle it!
